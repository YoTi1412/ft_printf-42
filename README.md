# ft_printf: A Custom Printf Implementation in C

## 🚀 Project Overview

`ft_printf` is a meticulously crafted, custom implementation of the standard C library's `printf` function, designed to provide a deep dive into low-level C programming techniques. This project demonstrates advanced programming skills by recreating a complex standard library function from scratch.

## 💡 Key Features

- Full-featured printf-like formatting for various data types
- Robust variadic argument handling
- Comprehensive format specifier support
- Efficient memory management
- Detailed error handling
- Extensible design

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- Implements custom parsing of format strings
- Uses `stdarg.h` for variadic argument processing
- Supports multiple format specifiers: `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, `%%`
- Handles complex formatting flags and width specifications
- Minimizes system calls for optimal performance

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By implementing `ft_printf`, developers gain invaluable insights into:
- Variadic function mechanics
- Low-level string parsing
- Custom output formatting
- Advanced C programming techniques
- Memory management strategies
